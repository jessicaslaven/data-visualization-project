# data-visualization-project

ðŸ“Š For this project, I used the ggplot2 package in RStudio to visualize the athletes_1 dataset in various ways.  

ðŸ“ˆ This is a beginner level data visualization project that produces the following visuals:  
 -scatterplot  
-vertical bar chart  
-boxplot  
-density plot  
-histogram  

ðŸ““ The dataset is called athletes-1 and contains 14 columns of data about athletes including:  
-BMI  
-Height   
-Weight  
-Sport Played  
-Hemoglobin Concentration
